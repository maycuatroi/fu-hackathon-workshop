# FU Hackathon Workshop

A collection of demo projects and examples for the FU Hackathon Workshop, showcasing various technologies and algorithms.

## Projects

### üó∫Ô∏è find-shortest-path/
Interactive web application demonstrating Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. Features a React/TypeScript frontend with visual graph representation and a Python backend for path calculation. Includes both static images and dynamic visualization.

### üåê get-map-from-server/
Python application that fetches map data from a remote API and displays graph information in the terminal using Rich formatting. Demonstrates API integration, graph data structures, and terminal UI enhancement.

### üí¨ mqtt-chat/
Real-time chat application using MQTT protocol. Includes both server and client implementations with features like user authentication, private messaging, and presence tracking. Great example of pub/sub messaging patterns.

### üîå web-socket/
WebSocket-based chat system with Python server and both Python and web clients. Demonstrates real-time bidirectional communication between server and multiple clients using WebSocket protocol.
